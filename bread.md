# Alex's Sourdough Process

I'm not a great baker, but I have learned a few things -- time to write them down and keep a list going.

This seems like a complicated list, but many of the steps are deceptively simple, and I find there is a lot of passive time while making bread.

1. I keep a starter at 100% hydration, and feed it once every 18-24 hours for a day or two before I want to make bread[^2]. This results in an active starter which doubles in a few hours -- which I've found very important for getting a good rise. I keep approximately 50g of starter, and add 50g of water and 50g of whole wheat flour every time I feed my starter.

2. Getting bread hydration right is very important. I've been working mostly with 66% hydration dough (e.g. 66g of water per 100g of dry ingredients). It is important to compute the final hydration of the dough, and account for the hydration of your starter (in my case, 100% hydration starter) in my measurements. I've found it is possible to tune the hydration to change the final crumb (e.g. size of the bubbles) in the bread. I keep a spreadsheet for this process.

3. On the day when I'm going to make bread, I start by separating out 50g of starter, and feeding it with 50g of water and 50g of whole wheat flour, in a separate container from my usual starter. This allows me to have exactly 150g of starter ready to go. I've seen this referred to as the Levain on some food blogs. I start this process early, so that my levain can get close to doubling when I add it into the bread dough. This lets me add a very active starter to the dough to really kick-start the rise.

4. At the time when I make the levain, I also prepare the remainder of the ingredients, and start the autolyse process. Many sourdough recipies recommend mixing your flour and water, and letting them sit for 20-30 minutes to start gluten development. I've seen some recommendations online, and had good experiences, mixing my flour and water after I mix my levain, and letting it autolyse for a few hours. For 66% hydration dough, (considering my 150g of 100% hydration starter, which I will add later) I mix 400g of flour with 238g of water.[^1] I do this in a bowl, and then cover the bowl and the levain and let them sit. I have been making bread which is 50% whole wheat flour, though most recipies suggest much less whole wheat flour relative to white flour, so variation is probably good. (The 50/50 mix I learned from a baking class at Companion Bakeshop, so I feel pretty good about it.)

5. When the levain has just about doubled in size, and looks quite bubbly, I carefully fold it in to the dry dough ingredients. The levain is usually pretty light and fluffy at this point, and I try to not pop all the bubbles as I combine it. After combining the ingredients, I put a few grams (really a generous pinch) of salt on top, which will get folded into the dough in the next few steps.

6. Now I start a process of stretch-and-folds. Approximately once every 30 minutes, I grab the dough, scraping it up off the bottom of the bowl, and gently stretch it out in one direction, and fold the ends back on top. I repeat the process in the opposite direction each time, making folds which look like the back of envelope. In this process, I am trying to develop the gluten so that I can form a boule later which will hold its shape. I don't want to pop the bubbles which are forming, so I try to be gentle. Dough has a tendency to stick to hands, and my original temptation was to flour my hands while working with dough, but I've learned that having very wet hands works just as well, doesn't seem to change the consistency of my dough as much as adding flour does. I will sometimes keep a bowl of water next to my dough, and dunk my hands as I'm about to work on it.

7. Ideally, I would repeat this process every 30 minutes until my dough passes the window-pane test (look it up on youtube for a good sense) where I can stretch a pinch / two thumbs of dough to the point that light can pass through it. In practice, I'm not great at the window pane test, and I tend to work with my dough until I can tell that the outside has some gluten structure to it. Usually, I feel by pinching the dough. The best sense I have for the feel is to aim for what dough feels like after I have made a boule. Unfortunately, this doesn't really work the first time -- but with a little bit of trial and error I got there.

8. Once my bread has developed enough gluten (and usually at this point, it has also started to rise a bit more), anywhere from 3 to 6 folds, I start the shaping process. Shaping is usually done in a pre-shape and then a final shaping -- though I think its is best to consider these two identical shaping processes, and if I create a great boule on the first go, I don't worry about the second try. To shape the dough, I remove it from the container and place it on a flat, lightly floured surface. Then, using my hands (or a bench scraper) I slide the dough to round it into a ball, in a motion which rolls dough from the top of the boule to the underside, and also rotates the boule in a circle. Honestly, youtube is a good source for shaping technique videos, and it takes practice. Essentially, I'm trying to get something circular, while tucking the edges under and into the middle of the ball. The outside at this point should be tacky and smooth, with the gluten holding the shape.

9. Lots of recipies recommend a pre-shape, where you gently begin the shaping process, and then a 20 minute rest before a final shaping -- I do this sometimes, and other times, my first boule comes out well (probably because I've done more stretch and folds than truly necessary).

10. Once I have the shaped bread, I put it upside-down in a proofing basket lined with cloth. I sprinkle rice flour (though regular flour works too, it just has the potential to change the hydration of the dough, especially for very wet (75%+ hydration) doughs). It should hold its shape roughly in the basket, but spread out a bit.

11. In the parts of this process above, I've been worried mostly about good gluten formation and a good shape for my dough. But I also want a good rise, so at this point, I want to leave my bread out until it has almost doubled in size. Sometimes, I can tell in the stretching and folding steps above that I've already hit the doubling point, and sometimes, an extra hour or two covered on the counter helps.

12. Once I think the dough has risen enough, I put it in the fridge, to slow the remaining rise process and firm up the shape of the loaf. For me, this is usually over night, becasue I tend to start making my bread around lunch time, and so I've finished the rise around 7 or 8 at night, and I don't want fresh bread for desert.

13. About an hour before I'm going to bake my loaf, I take it out of the fridge and let it rest on the counter. Sometimes it will even start to rise again.

14. Half an hour before baking, I put an empty cast iron pan in the oven on the bottom shelf, and pre-heat the oven to 425ÂºF. This extra pre-heating time lets the cast iron come to a high temperature, and ensures that the oven is failry evenly heated.

15. To get a good crust, I need steam. I haven't tried using a dutch oven for this process yet, but I have found the cast iron pan method pretty successful. Before I put the bread in the oven, I boil a tea pot of water, and pour the boiling water into the cast iron. This will create a lot of moisture and steam in the oven.

16. To prepare the loaf for baking, I carefully turn the loaf out of the proofing basket, and on to a baking sheet with parchment paper. This is usually my moment of truth -- a good loaf will hold its shape quite well at this point, if I've messed something up, it will usually slump and squish. I then score the loaf -- ideally, I'd have a sharp razor blade to score it, but I find I can get away with a knife as well. Scoring helps the loaf rise in directions you want, i.e. up and not out to the side. I find I have to score more deeply than I thought, its not enough to just get through the outer layer of gluten.

17. Then I put the loaf in the oven. I'll often squirt it with a spray bottle to slow the crust formation even further. I leave the loaf in the oven for 35-40 minutes, or longer if it doesn't seem solid yet. After all this time, I take out the loaf and let it cool, before having a little bit of bread.

#### Footnotes

[^2]: Ideally I would be more consistent about this process, but I find that I remember about once a day. As a bit of a cheat, I tend to feed my starter in the evenings, and then start making bread in the morning, so that the last feeding is closer to a 12 hour interval. But feeding every 12 hours consistently is a bit too much for me.
[^1]: In the end, I'll have combined 400g of flour, 238g of water, and an additional 75g of flour and 75g of water from the levain, totalling 475g of dry ingredients and 313g of water. Also, I usually need to double check my math, because I've often carelessly done things like put 313g of water into the dough, forgetting that there is water in the starter, and that really screws things up.
