# Experience

## Head of Data Science 

**[Bitly](https://bitly.com) IQ -- San Francisco, CA** -- *August 2019 to Present*

- Responsible for the roadmap, hiring, and cross-functional prioritization for the Data Science team at Bitly.
- Created NLP skip-gram models to provide semantic tagging for billions of crawled pages across consumer industries.
- Built a cloud-native machine learning pipeline for building models using TensorFlow on Bitly’s click and web history.
- Trained and implemented state-of-the-art bot identification using a recursive neural network.
- Developed a natural language model to identify suspicious and malicious URLs on the Bitly platform.

## Senior Data Scientist
**[Even](https://even.com) -- Oakland, CA – Founding member of the data team** -- *March 2018 to August 2019*

- Developed a novel ML algorithm to apply active learning and hierarchical clustering to personal financial transaction data. The algorithm allows our app to budget for predictable expenses, powering 250,000 personal financial plans.
- Led the design and architecture of a new data warehouse to expose business data to Even employees. Built and evangelized the use of transformed data with business definitions, democratizing analysis across the company.
- Wrote and developed an impact study demonstrating the 45% improvement to employee retention associated with using the Even app in collaboration with Walmart’s Human Resources and Benefits departments.
- Bootstrapped and launched an underwriting model to identify working hours of employees using location data.
- Mentor and technical leader for Data Scientists and Data Engineers on the data team.

## Data Scientist
**LendUp -- San Francisco, CA – became [Mission Lane](https://www.missionlane.com) in 2018** -- *July 2017 to March 2018*

- Built and deployed a performant, ECOA compliant underwriting model for applicants with bankruptcies which accounts for 80% of credit card approvals and drove significant business growth.
- Created a data-driven credit card net present value model for our portfolio and a business intelligence GUI which became the primary tool for data driven product strategy decisions.
- Developed a loss-rate forecasting model to allow early identification of credit card defaults in the first 3 statements.

## National Science Foundation Research Fellow
**[University of California, Santa Cruz](https://ucsc.edu), [University of California Observatories](https://ucolick.org), and [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov)** -- *September 2012 to July 2017*

- Developed operational and real time software for a research facility adaptive optics instrument at Lick Observatory.
- Demonstrated the use of a predictive Kalman filter to correct for wind errors on a 1kHz adaptive optics system.

## Fulbright Research Fellow	
**[Foundation for Scholarly Exchange](http://www.fulbright.org.tw) and [National Central University Graduate Institute of Astronomy](http://www.astro.ncu.edu.tw/) – Zhongli, Taiwan** -- *September 2011 to June 2012*
