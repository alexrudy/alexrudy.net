# Overview
- Strategy and execution focused, seeking small teams where I can have a big impact and fill gaps across an organization.
- Experience which spans model building, backend engineering, data warehouses, and machine learning pipelines.
- Strong track record of deploying high-impact compliant machine learning models for a variety of business applications.
- Experience with a wide variety of modeling techniques: tree-based ensemble models, neural networks, hierarchical bayesian models, regression, and ruin-and-recreate optimization problems.
- Proven system architect: high-throughput backend APIs, data warehouses, ELT pipelines, and ML pipelines.
- Developed and deployed extensively in Python, SQL, C and Rust. Experience with C++, Go, JavaScript, Ruby, Fortran & R. Maintained CI pipelines, canonical docker images, and contributes to open source python (papermill & matplotlib).
